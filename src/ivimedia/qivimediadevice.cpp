    \brief QIviMediaDevice is the base class for all Media Devices

    A Media Device is an externally or internally connected device on which media is stored.
    It can be a physical medium like a USB thumbdrive or a CD/DVD, but it could also be a DLNA Media Server running
    on a different machine e.g. on the rear seat entertainment system.

    Media Devices can be retrieved by using the QIviMediaDeviceDiscoveryModel, which asks the backend
    which devices it knows of that are currently connected to the IVI system.
