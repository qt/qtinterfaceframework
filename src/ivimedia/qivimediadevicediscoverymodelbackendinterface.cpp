    \brief The QIviMediaDeviceDiscoveryModelBackendInterface defines the interface for backends to the
    QIviMediaDeviceDiscoveryModel feature class.

    The QIviMediaDeviceDiscoveryModelBackendInterface is the interface used by \l QIviMediaDeviceDiscoveryModel

    The interface is discovered by a \l QIviMediaDeviceDiscoveryModel object, which connects to it and sets it up.

    <example of a fully featured backend>

/*!
    Constructs a backend interface.

    The \a parent is sent to the QObject constructor.

/*!
    \fn QIviMediaDeviceDiscoveryModelBackendInterface::initialize()

    Initializes the backend. This function is called after a feature connected to the backend.
    It is expected that this function will use the availableDevices signal to inform the feature about the
    currently available devices.

    \note It may happen that a second feature instance is connecting to the same backend and because of this,
    this function can be called multiple times. The implementation should inform about the current state after every call.

    \sa availableDevices()
*/

//TODO add a unit test for testing multiple features instances connecting to the same instance.

/*!
    \fn void QIviMediaDeviceDiscoveryModelBackendInterface::availableDevices(const QList<QIviServiceObject*> devices)

    This signal is emitted after a call to initialize() and indicates all the already connected \a devices, which are ready
    to be used.

    \sa initialize()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QIviMediaDeviceDiscoveryModelBackendInterface::deviceAdded(QIviServiceObject *device)

    This signal is emitted when a new \a device is added to the system and is ready to be used.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QIviMediaDeviceDiscoveryModelBackendInterface::deviceRemoved(QIviServiceObject *device)

    This signal is emitted when a \a device has been removed from the system and cannot be used anymore.
