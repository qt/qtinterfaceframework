    \brief The QIviMediaIndexerControlBackendInterface defines the interface for backends to the
    QIviMediaIndexerControl feature class.

    The QIviMediaIndexerControlBackendInterface is the interface used by \l QIviMediaIndexerControl

    The interface is discovered by a \l QIviMediaIndexerControl object, which connects to it and sets it up.

    <example of a fully featured backend>

/*!
    Constructs a backend interface.

    The \a parent is sent to the QObject constructor.

/*!
    \fn QIviMediaIndexerControlBackendInterface::initialize()

    Initializes the backend. This function is called after a feature connected to the backend.
    It is expected that this function will use the stateChanged and the progressChanged signals to inform the feature about the
    current state of the indexing.

    \sa stateChanged() progressChanged()
*/

/*!
    \fn QIviMediaIndexerControlBackendInterface::pause()

    Pauses the currently ongoing indexing. If currently no indexing is ongoing this call should not perform any actions.

    \sa resume()
*/

/*!
    \fn QIviMediaIndexerControlBackendInterface::resume()

    Resumes the previously paused indexing. If there is nothing to resume this call should not perform any actions.

    \sa pause()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QIviMediaIndexerControlBackendInterface::progressChanged(qreal progress)

    This signal is emitted when indexing is currently ongoing and the progress of the operation changed.
    The \a progress argument passes the current progress between \e 0 and \e 1.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QIviMediaIndexerControlBackendInterface::stateChanged(QIviMediaIndexerControl::State state)

    This signal is emitted whenever the indexing state changed. The \a state argument holds the new state
    of the indexer.
