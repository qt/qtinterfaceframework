     \title Climate Control Widget Example

     \brief This example shows how to access the climate control from C++.
     \image examples_climate_widget.png

     This example shows how to access the climate control from the C++.

     The first thing to do is to create a QIviClimateControl instance in our
     MainWindow constructor. As we only have one Climate backend and don't want
     to choose which one to use, we call \l {QIviAbstractFeature::}{startAutoDiscovery()}
     to start searching for a suitable backend right away and pick the first one
     that matches.

     \l {QIviClimateControl::}{isValid()} is used for verifying that the
     autoDiscovery found a backend:
     \snippet ivivehiclefunctions/climate_widget/mainwindow.cpp 1

     The constructor then continues to connect the climate control
     attribute change signals to the UI components:
     \snippet ivivehiclefunctions/climate_widget/mainwindow.cpp 2

     Airflow direction is controlled using these functions:
     \snippet ivivehiclefunctions/climate_widget/mainwindow.cpp 3
