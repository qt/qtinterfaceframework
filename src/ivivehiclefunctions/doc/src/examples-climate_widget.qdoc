     \brief The Example shows how to access the climate control from C++.

     The example shows how to access the climate control from the C++.

     The first thing to do is to create a QtIVIClimateControl instance in our
     MainWindow constructor. As we only have one Climate backend and don't want
     to choose which to use, we call \l {QtIVIAbstractFeature::}{startAutoDiscovery()}
     to start searching for a suitable backend right away and pick the first one
     that matches.

     \l {QtIVIClimateControl::}{isValid()} is used for verifying that the
     autodiscovery found a backend:

     The \e setupUI() function contains code to connect the climate control
     attribute change signals to the UI components.

     Airflow direction is controlled using these functions:
