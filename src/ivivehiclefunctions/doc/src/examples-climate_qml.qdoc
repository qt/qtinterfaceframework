     \title Climate Control QML Example
     \ingroup qtivivehiclefunctions_examples

     \brief The Example shows how to access the climate control from QML.
     \image examples_climate_qml.png

     The example shows how to access the climate control from QML.

     In the example, ClimateControl is created and autoDiscovery enabled.
     When autoDiscovery is enabled, the module starts searching for the presence
     of a plugin that implements QIviClimateControlBackendInterface.
     \snippet climate_qml/main.qml 1

     If discovery fails, a message dialog is shown:
     \snippet climate_qml/main.qml 4

     As a Climate System can support multiple climate zones, we need to
     differentiate between the zones. A \e {general zone} can be used for settings
     that are applied to all zones.

     General ClimateControl attribute values are handled in check boxes as follows:
     \snippet climate_qml/main.qml 2

     For the zoned ClimateControl, the \l [QML] {AbstractZonedFeature::}{zoneAt}
     property is used for controlling the values from the front left climate zone:
     \snippet climate_qml/main.qml 3
