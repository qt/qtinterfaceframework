\title Using the Qt IVI Reference API

\section1 Overview

The Qt IVI module contains a reference API providing interfaces to common automotive
functionality. These APIs rely on the separation of the front-end API and the backend
implementation. The Qt IVI module also introduces a set of concepts used in the APIs:
zones and property attributes. More about the concepts can be read \l {Concepts} {here}.

\section1 Modules

Qt IVI consists of the following C++ modules:

\annotatedlist qtivi_modules

\b {Qt IVI Core} provides core base classes for the Qt IVI features,
and handles the discovery of Qt IVI backend plugins. Application
developers do not need to use Qt IVI Core directly. It is only needed
when implementing a new IVI feature, such as Qt IVI Vehicle Functions
ClimateControl.

\b {Qt IVI Vehicle Functions} provides interfaces to access vehicle
features.

\b {Qt IVI Media} provides interfaces to access media related APIs e.g.
Managing your music playlist or controlling the radio tuner.

The functionality provided by these modules is available to QML
applications:
