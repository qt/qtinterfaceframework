    \title Qt IVI
    \keyword QtIvi

    The Qt IVI (In-Vehicle Infotainment) module provides C++ classes and QML types
    for accessing vehicle features, as well as a core API for implementing
    new IVI features.

    \section1 Modules

    Qt IVI consists of the following C++ modules:

    \annotatedlist qtivi_modules

    \b {Qt IVI Vehicle Functions} provides interfaces to access vehicle
    features.

    \b {Qt IVI Core} provides core base classes for the Qt IVI features,
    and handles the discovery of Qt IVI backend plugins. Application
    developers do not need to use Qt IVI Core directly. It is only needed
    when implementing a new IVI feature, such as Qt IVI Vehicle Functions
    ClimateControl.

    The functionality provided by these modules is available to QML
    applications:
