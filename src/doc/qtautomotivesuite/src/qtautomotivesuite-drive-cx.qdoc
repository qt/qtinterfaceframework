    Take the following steps when preparing \l {http://www.nvidia.com/object/drive-cx.html}
    {NVIDIA DRIVE CX} for \B2Q:

    \note It is important that you repeat the steps in this section after you
    update \QAS.

    The image containing the \B2Q stack for the device, as well as the
    flashing tool are included in \QAS.

    \note The flashing tool that is used in \l{Installing the Boot to Qt Image} is
    only supported in a Linux host platform.

    \section1 Installing the \B2Q Image

    Connect the DRIVE CX board to the development host via USB, and set it in
    \e {recovery mode} by changing the position of J9 jumper on the board.

    Then, run the flashing tool:

    \badcode
        cd <INSTALL_DIR>
        sudo 5.9/Automotive/tegra-t18x/flash-nvidia/flash_device.sh
    \endcode

    After the installation is complete, replace the J9 jumper to its original
    position, and restart the device. After reboot, check that the automotive
    UI appears.

    \section1 Setting up USB Access

    \include qtas-post-install-setup.qdocinc setting up usb access

    \section1 Configuring a Device Kit in Qt Creator

    \include qtas-post-install-setup.qdocinc configuring device kit linux

    You are now ready to start developing for your device. For more information,
    see \l{Tutorial: Deploying Your First Project with Qt Automotive Suite}.
