//! [setting up usb access]
    On Ubuntu Linux, the development user account must have access to plugged in
    devices. To allow the development user access to the device via USB, create
    a new \e{udev} rule.
    \list 1

        \li From Qt 5.9 onwards, run the following command in a shell:

    \badcode
        echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="dbdb", TAG+="udev-acl", TAG+="uaccess"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/70-boot2qt.rules
    \endcode

        For Qt 5.8 or older, run the following command in a shell:

    \badcode
        echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="18d1", TAG+="udev-acl", TAG+="uaccess"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/70-boot2qt.rules
    \endcode

        \li Connect the running device to the development host with a USB
    cable. If the device is already connected, disconnect and reconnect the USB
    cable after running the command above.
    \endlist

    The system log files \c{/var/log/udev} and \c{/var/log/syslog} may
    provide relevant information in case of connection problems.

//! [setting up usb access]

//! [configuring device kit linux]
    After you have prepared the hardware, you must perform one final step
    to set up the development tools in Qt Creator for your device. That is,
    you must configure the correct device to be used for each build and run
    \e{kit}. Connect your device to the development host via USB and launch
    Qt Creator. In Qt Creator:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol{Tools} > \uicontrol {Options} > \uicontrol {Build & Run}
        > \uicontrol {Kits}.
        \li Select one of the predefined kits starting with \e{Boot to Qt...}
        that matches the type of your device.
        \li Select the correct device in the \uicontrol{Device} field.
        \li Select \uicontrol{OK}.
    \endlist
