\brief Provides a static tuner simulation.

\section1 Supported interfaces
\list
    \li \l{org.qt-project.qtivi.AmFmTuner/1.0}
    \li \l{org.qt-project.qtivi.SearchAndBrowseModel/1.0}
\endlist

The backend will return a fixed set of radio stations on the FM band and no stations on the AM band.

For the SearchAndBrowseModel the following contenTypes are supported:
\list
    \li \b station A list of all stations found.
    \li \b presets A list for storing the users favorite stations.
\endlist

\note Both lists don't support filtering and sorting.

\title QtIviMedia MediaPlayer Simulation Backend
\ingroup qtivimedia_backend
\ingroup qtivi_backend

\brief Provides a media player simulation using QtMultimedia.

\section1 Requirements
\list
    \li QtMultimedia
    \li taglib
\endlist

\section1 Supported interfaces
\list
    \li \l{org.qt-project.qtivi.MediaPlayer/1.0}
    \li \l{org.qt-project.qtivi.MediaIndexer/1.0}
    \li \l{org.qt-project.qtivi.MediaDiscovery/1.0}
    \li \l{org.qt-project.qtivi.SearchAndBrowseModel/1.0}
\endlist

The backend uses QtMultimedia to offer real media playback on various platforms.
The indexer will automatically start to index all \c mp3 files in the media folder.

For the SearchAndBrowseModel the following contenTypes are supported:
\list
    \li \b artist A list of all artists.
    \li \b album A list of all albums.
    \li \b track A list of all tracks.
\endlist

The model supports filtering and sorting, as well as navigating through the media library using
the following navigation paths:

\list
    \li Artist -> Album -> Track
    \li Album -> Track
\endlist

\note On systems where \c taglib wasn't found, indexing of files doesn't work and because of that
the media database can't be created.

\section1 Configuration

This backend uses environment variables for its configuration. By default it will use
a non persistent mode, where the indexed media database is not saved, but recreated on every start
of the app.

\table
\header
    \li Name
    \li Description
\row
    \li QTIVIMEDIA_SIMULATOR_DATABASE
    \li A path to the media database which should be used.
\row
    \li QTIVIMEDIA_SIMULATOR_LOCALMEDIAFOLDER
    \li The local media directory (default: /home/<user>/media)
\row
    \li QTIVIMEDIA_SIMULATOR_DEVICEFOLDER
    \li The path which will be used by the DiscoveryModel for discovering media devices.
        (default: /home/<user>/usb-simulation)
