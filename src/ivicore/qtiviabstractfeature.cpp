 * \class QtIVIAbstractFeature
 * \inmodule QtIVICore
 * \brief The QtIVIAbstractFeature is the base class for all QtIVI Features
 *
 * QtIVIAbstractFeature is the base class for the front facing API towards the developer.
 * The QtIVIAbstractFeature provides you with a way to automatically connect to a backend implementing
 * the interface needed. This discovery is started by using the startAutoDiscovery() function.
 *
 * Once the auto discovery is done, it can be checked whether a backend has been found by using the
 * isValid function.
 *
 * The auto discovery gives you an easy way to automatically connect to the right backend implementation.
 * If you don't want to use the auto discovery, it's also possible to use QtIVIServiceManager to retrieve
 * all Backends and search manually for the right one and connect it to the QtIVIAbstractFeature by calling
 * setServiceObject().
 *
 * The type of backend to be loaded can be controlled by setting the auto discovery mode. By default,
 * it is set to AutoDiscovery, which indicates that a production backend will be preferred over a simulation backend.
 *
 * QtIVIAbstractFeature is an abstract base class that needs to be subclassed to create an API for your
 * Feature.
 *
 * \chapter Subclassing
 *
 * When subclassing QtIVIAbstractFeature, you must provide implementations of the following functions:
 * \list
 * \li acceptServiceObject()
 * \li connectToServiceObject()
 * \li disconnectFromServiceObject()
 * \li clearServiceObject()
 * \endlist
 *
 * Once a QtIVIServiceObject has been set, either by auto discovery or by manually setting it, the acceptServiceObject()
 * function will be called to make sure the QtIVIServiceObject provides everything needed by the Feature.
 *
 * If the interface provides signals, you need to do all the connect statements in connectToServiceObject() and
 * disconnect them again in disconnectFromServiceObject().
 *
 * clearServiceObject() will be called once the Feature doesn't have a connection to a ServiceObject anymore and should
 * reset its state to sane defaults.
