 * \class QtIVIAbstractFeature
 * \inmodule QtIVICore
 * \brief The QtIVIAbstractFeature is the base class for all QtIVI Featues
 *
 * QtIVIAbstractFeature is the base class for the front facing API towards the Developer.
 * The QtIVIAbstractFeature provides you with a way to automatically connect to a Backend implementing
 * your needed interface. This discovery is started by using the startAutoDiscovery() function.
 *
 * Once the auto discovery is done, it can be checked whether a backend has been found by using the
 * isValid function.
 *
 * The auto discovery gives you a easy way to automatically connect to the right backend implementation.
 * If you don't want to use the auto discovery, it's also possible to use QtIVIServiceManager to retrieve
 * all Backends and search manually for the right one and connect it to the QtIVIAbstractFeature by calling
 * setServiceObject()
 *
 * QtIVIAbstractFeature is a abstract base class which needs to be subclassed to create a API for your
 * Feature.
 *
 * \chapter Subclassing
 *
 * When subclassing QtIVIAbstractFeature you must provide implementations of the following functions:
 * \list
 * \li acceptServiceObject()
 * \li connectToServiceObject()
 * \li disconnectFromServiceObject()
 * \li clearServiceObject()
 * \endlist
 *
 * Once a QtIVIServiceObject has be set, either by auto discovery or by manually setting it the acceptServiceObject()
 * function will be called to make sure the QtIVIServiceObject provides everything which is needed by the Feature.
 *
 * If the interface provides signals you need to do all the connect statements in connectToServiceObject() and
 * disconnect them again in disconnectFromServiceObject().
 *
 * clearServiceObject() will be called once the Feature doesn't have a connection to a ServiceObject anymore and should
 * reset it's state to sane defaults
 */

/*!
 * \fn bool QtIVIAbstractFeature::acceptServiceObject(QtIVIServiceObject *so)
 *
 * This method is expected to be implemented by any class subclassing QtIVIAbstractFeature.
 *
 * This method is expected to return \c true if the given service object, \a so, is accepted and
 * can be used, otherwise \c false.
 *
 * If the object is accepted, \l connectToServiceObject is called to actually connect to the
 * service object.

 * \sa connectToServiceObject(), disconnectFromServiceObject(), clearServiceObject()

/*!
 * \fn void QtIVIAbstractFeature::connectToServiceObject(QtIVIServiceObject *so)
 *
 * This method is expected to be implemented by any class subclassing QtIVIAbstractFeature.
 *
 * The implementation is expected to connect to the service object, \a so, and to set all
 * properties to reflect the state of the service object.
 *
 * There is no previous service object connected, as this call always is preceeded by a call to
 * \l disconnectFromServiceObject or \l clearServiceObject.
 *
 * It is safe to assume that the service object, \a so, has always been accepted through the
 * \l acceptServiceObject method prior to being passed to this method.

/*!
 * \fn void QtIVIAbstractFeature::disconnectFromServiceObject(QtIVIServiceObject *so)

 *
 * It is not expected that the implementation goes to safe defaults. A call to this function is
 * always followed by a call to \l connectToServiceObject or \l clearServiceObject.

/*!
 * \fn void QtIVIAbstractFeature::clearServiceObject()
 *
 * This method is expected to be implemented by any class subclassing QtIVIAbstractFeature.

 *
 * There is no need to disconnect from the service object. If it still exists, it is guaranteed
 * that \l disconnectFromServiceObject is called first.
