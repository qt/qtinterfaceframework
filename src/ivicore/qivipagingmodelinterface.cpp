    \brief The QIviPagingModelInterface defines the interface for backends to the
    QIviPagingModel feature class.

    The QIviPagingModelInterface is the interface used by \l QIviPagingModel

    The interface is discovered by a \l QIviPagingModel object, which connects to it and sets it up.

    Every QIviPagingModel generates its own QUuid which is passed to the backend interface and can
    be used to identify a model instance.

    \sa QIviPagingModel

    //TODO explain how the interface works on a example
    <example of a fully featured backend>
*/

/*!
    \fn QIviPagingModelInterface::QIviPagingModelInterface(QObject *parent = nullptr)

    Constructs a backend interface.

    The \a parent is sent to the QObject constructor.

/*!
    \fn void QIviPagingModelInterface::fetchData(const QUuid &identifier, int start, int count)

    This function is called whenever new data needs to be retrieved by a QIviPagingModel identified by \a identifier.

    The parameters \a start and \a count define the range of data which should be fetched. This method is expected to emit the dataFetched() signal once
    the new data is ready.

    \sa dataFetched()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QIviPagingModelInterface::supportedCapabilitiesChanged(const QUuid &identifier, QtIviCoreModule::ModelCapabilities capabilities)

    Emitted when the \a capabilities of the model instance identified by \a identifier changed.

    \note If a null QQuuid is used as a identifier, all model instances will be informed.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QIviPagingModelInterface::countChanged(const QUuid &identifier, int newLength)

    This signal is emitted when the current number of items in the QIviPagingModel instance identified by \a identifier changed.
    The new number of items is returned as \a newLength.

    This signal is expected to be emitted after the model instance has requested new data for the first time by calling fetchData() and
    should be emitted before the data is returned by emitting the dataFetched() signal.

    \note If a null QQuuid is used as a identifier, all model instances will be informed.

    \sa fetchData() dataFetched()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QIviPagingModelInterface::dataFetched(const QUuid &identifier, const QList<QVariant> &data, int start, bool moreAvailable)

    This signal is emitted as a result of a call to fetchData() and returns the requested data in the argument \a data to the QIviPagingModel instance identified by \a identifier.
    The arguments \a start holds the index where the data starts and \a moreAvailable holds whether there is more data available and a new fetchData() call can be used to retrieve this data.

    \note If a null QQuuid is used as a identifier, all model instances will be informed.

    \sa fetchData() dataFetched()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QIviPagingModelInterface::dataChanged(const QUuid &identifier, const QList<QVariant> &data, int start, int count)

    This signal is emitted whenever the data in the QIviPagingModel instance identified by \a identifier changed and the model needs to be updated.
    The new data is passed as \a data. The arguments \a start and \a count can be used to define the set of items which should be replaced with the new data.

    For inserting a new item, the item is passed in \a data and \a start is used for where the item should be inserted, the \a count argument needs to be 0 as we don't want to replace existing data:

    \code
    QList<ExampleItem> list;
    ExampleItem item = ExampleItem();
    list.insert(index, item);
    QVariantList items = { QVariant::fromValue(item) };
    emit dataChanged(items, index, 0);
    \endcode

    Removing an item is very similar, \a start is used to indicate which item and \a count to indicate how much:

    \code
    list.removeAt(index);
    emit dataChanged(identifier, QVariantList(), index, 1);
    \endcode

    \note If a null QQuuid is used as a identifier, all model instances will be informed.
