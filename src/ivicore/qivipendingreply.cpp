    \brief A object representing an asynchronous results

    A PendingReply is a way for providing asynchronous results. It can be used as a
    return value for asynchronous functions.

    The QML API is very similar to
    \l{https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises}{JavaScript Promises}.

    This documentation shows how to use the PendingReply from within QML and how to execute code
    once the asynchronous result is ready.

    \note It is not supported to create a PendingReply from QML. The object is supposed to be
    created from C++ and returned to QML as a result. For more information on how to use it from
    C++ see the \l {QIviPendingReply}{QIviPendingReply documentation}.

    When a PendingReply is created from C++ it doesn't have a result set yet and the
    \l{PendingReply::}{resultAvailable} property is \c false. A result for the pending reply can
    only be set once and it either indicates a failed(setFailed) or a successful(setSuccess) call.
    This can be checked using the \l{PendingReply::}{success} property. The actual result is
    available from the \l{PendingReply::}{value} property, which returns undefined if no result is
    available or the reply failed.

    \section1 Using a PendingReply

    As explained above, the PendingReply is supposed to be used as a return value for asynchronous
    operations done in C++. To inform about when a reply result is available there are two ways:

    \section2 The \e then method

    Similar to a JavaScript Promise the PendingReply is then-able, which means it provides a \e then
    method. This method can be used to add callbacks which are executed when the reply succeeds or
    fails.

    \qml
    import QtQuick 2.0
    import QtIvi 1.0

    Text {
        id: root
        text: "not ready"

        Component.onCompleted: {
            var asyncReply = TestObject.asyncFunction();
            asyncReply.then(function(value) {
                                root.text = "reply ready: " + value
                            },
                            function() {
                                root.text = "reply failed"
                            })
        }
    }
    \endqml

    This simple QML snippet calls the C++ function TestObject::asyncFunction() which returns a
    PendingReply. See the \l{QIviPendingReply}{C++ part} on how to write such a function and use
    the PendingReply from C++.

    The then method is used to register two callbacks. The first callback is the result callback
    and takes the reply value as an argument. This will update the text element accordingly. The
    second argument is the failed callback, which doesn't take an argument as there is no valid
    reply value.

    If the failed state is not of interest it is also possible to not add any callback for it e.g.
    \qml
    asyncReply.then(function(value) {
                        root.text = "reply ready: " + value
                    })
    \endqml

    In a similar way only the failed callback can be registered by passing \e undefined to the
    function as the first argument:

    \qml
    asyncReply.then(undefined,
                    function() {
                        root.text = "reply failed"
                    })
    \endqml

    \section3 Synchronous results

    When a PendingReply object is used in an API the corresponding function cannot provide the
    result immediately. But especially for input validation the function can return an error state
    right away. For this the PendingReply object offers the properties
    \l{PendingReply::}{resultAvailable} and \l{PendingReply::}{success} to check for this when the
    object is given for QML.

    Checking this for every PendingReply use in QML can be tedious and produces a lot of
    boiler-plate code. Because of this the PendingReply works similar to a JavaScript Promise and
    will execute the callbacks although the result is already available.

    \section2 Signals and Slots

    Although the then method is the recommended way from QML, the PendingReply also provides
    signals. To make the PendingReply as lightweight as possible it is using Q_GADGET and cannot
    provide signals directly, but provides it through the QIviPendingReplyWatcher class. The
    QIviPendingReplyWatcher can be accessed using the \l{PendingReply::}{watcher} property.

    \note The QIviPendingReplyWatcher is owned by the PendingReply. Saving the watcher outside of
    of the PendingReply is not safe as it is destroyed once all copies of this PendingReply object
    are destroyed.
*/

/*!
    \class QIviPendingReply
    \inmodule QtIviCore
    \brief Template class for providing asynchronous results

    A QIviPendingReply is a template class for providing asynchronous results. It can be used as a
    return value for asynchronous functions, similar to QFuture.

    In contrast to QFuture, QIviPendingReply works also in QML and is especially made for this. The
    data stored in a QIviPendingReply is implicitly shared between all copies of this reply object.
    This keeps the memory and performance footprint low.

    The QML API is very similar to
    \l{https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises}{JavaScript Promises}, at
    the same time the C++ API provides support for Qt's signals and slots.

    The QIviPendingReply holds a result of a specific type. The type needs to have a default
    constructor and a copy constructor. By default the most Qt basic types are supported. New types
    can be added by using the qIviRegisterPendingReplyType function.

    When a QIviPendingReply is created it does not have a valid result set yet. This can be checked
    by using the resultAvailable property. A result for a reply can be set by using the setFailed
    or setSuccess functions. Setting the result with this function can only be done once and cannot
    be changed later. Whether a QIviPendingReply has succeeded can be determined by the success
    property.

    \section1 Writing a function returning a QIviPendingReply

    When writing a function returning a QIviPendingReply, it is often needed to do some input
    validation and return before actual doing something. Without using a QIviPendingReply one would
    write a function as follows:

    \code
    QString displayName(const QUuid &id)
    {
        if (id.isNull)
            return QString();

        //do something and wait until the result is ready (synchronous)
        asyncAPI.getDisplayName(id);
        asyncAPI.waitForFinished(&displayNameChanged);
        return asyncAPI.displayName();
    }
    \endcode

    This function is using an asynchronous API e.g. provided by an IPC. getDisplayName(id) starts
    the task and once a result is ready the displayNameChanged signal is emitted and the actual
    value can be read using the displayName() function. The provided function is using a
    waitForFinished() method to actual wait for the signal to be emitted and return the value and
    make this API synchronous.

    When moving this code to using QIviPendingReply the validation check needs to be fixed to
    return a valid QIviPendingReply. To make it more convenient to return a failed reply, the
    QIviPendingReply::createFailedReply() function be used.

    Rewriting the above function to be fully asynchronous using a QIviPendingReply it would look
    like this:

    \code
    QIviPendingReply<QString> displayName(const QUuid &id)
    {
        if (id.isNull)
            return QIviPendingReply<QString>::createFailedReply();

        QIviPendingReply<QString> reply
        //connect to the change signal and set the result to the async reply when ready
        connect(asyncAPI, &displayNameChanged, this, [reply, asyncAPI]() mutable {
                reply.setSuccess(asyncAPI.displayName());
        });
        //start getting the name
        asyncAPI.getDisplayName(id);
        return reply;
    }
    \endcode

    Now a new QIviPendingReply is created right away and passed to the lamda used in the connect
    statement. The actual task is started afterwards and the reply object is returned. Once the
    async API emits the displayNameChanged signal the lamda is executed the QIviPendingReply is
    marked as successful and the value set to the displayName().

    \note All copies of a QIviPendingReply use implicit sharing. This data is freed once all copies
    of the pending replies are deleted.

    \section1 Using functions returning a QIviPendingReply

    When using a function which returns a QIviPendingReply, the first thing to do is to check
    whether a result is already available using the isResultAvailable property and act accordingly.
    Afterwards you can start to connect the signals provided by the QIviPendingReplyWatcher.

    \section2 Signals and Slots

    In order to keep the memory footprint low, the QIviPendingReply doesn't provide signals
    directly, as it doesn't need to derive from QObject, but uses the Q_GADGET macro instead. To
    get notified once a result is ready, the QIviPendingReplyWatcher can be used instead. The
    watcher can be retrieved using the watcher property.

    Here an example on how this would work when using the API described above:

    \code
    QUuid uuid = createUuid();
    QIviPendingReply<QString> reply = displayName(uuid);
    if (reply.isResultAvailable()) {
        if (reply.isSuccessfull())
            useDisplayName(reply.value());
        else
            qWarning("getting the displayName failed");
    } else {
        connect(reply.watcher(), &QIviPendingReplyWatcher::valueChanged, this, [this, reply]() {
            if (reply.isSuccessfull())
                useDisplayName(reply.value());
            else
                qWarning("getting the displayName failed");
        });
    }
    \endcode

    As described above, the pending reply is checked first for whether a result is already available
    and if not, the signals from the watcher are used to react to the valueChanged signal.

    \note The QIviPendingReplyWatcher returned is owned by the QIviPendingReply and all its
    copies. If all copies of the QIviPendingReply get deleted its QIviPendingReplyWatcher gets
    deleted as well.

    For usage in QML see the QML documentation.

    \fn qIviRegisterPendingReplyType(const char *typeName)
    \relates QIviPendingReply

    Registers the type name \a typeName for the type \c{T} for usage inside a QIviPendingReply. Any
    class or struct that has a public default constructor, a public copy constructor and a public
    destructor can be registered.

    This function requires that \c{T} is a fully defined type at the point where the function is
    called. For pointer types, it also requires that the pointed-to type is fully defined. Use
    Q_DECLARE_OPAQUE_POINTER() to be able to register pointers to forward declared types.

    Please see qRegisterMetaType for more information.
