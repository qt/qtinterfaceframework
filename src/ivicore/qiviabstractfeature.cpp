    \class QIviAbstractFeature
    \inmodule QtIviCore
    \brief The QIviAbstractFeature is the base class for all QtIvi Features

    QIviAbstractFeature is the base class for the front facing API towards the developer.
    The QIviAbstractFeature provides you with a way to automatically connect to a backend implementing
    the interface needed. This discovery is started by using the startAutoDiscovery() function.

    Once the auto discovery is done, it can be checked whether a backend has been found by using the
    isValid function.

    The auto discovery gives you an easy way to automatically connect to the right backend implementation.
    If you don't want to use the auto discovery, it's also possible to use QIviServiceManager to retrieve
    all Backends and search manually for the right one and connect it to the QIviAbstractFeature by calling
    setServiceObject().

    The type of backend to be loaded can be controlled by setting the auto discovery mode. By default,
    it is set to AutoDiscovery, which indicates that a production backend will be preferred over a simulation backend.

    QIviAbstractFeature is an abstract base class that needs to be subclassed to create an API for your
    Feature.

    \chapter Subclassing

    When subclassing QIviAbstractFeature, you must provide implementations of the following functions:
    \list
    \li acceptServiceObject()
    \li connectToServiceObject()
    \li disconnectFromServiceObject()
    \li clearServiceObject()
    \endlist

    Once a QIviServiceObject has been set, either by auto discovery or by manually setting it, the acceptServiceObject()
    function will be called to make sure the QIviServiceObject provides everything needed by the Feature.

    If the interface provides signals, you need to do all the connect statements in connectToServiceObject() and
    disconnect them again in disconnectFromServiceObject().

    clearServiceObject() will be called once the Feature doesn't have a connection to a ServiceObject anymore and should
    reset its state to sane defaults.
