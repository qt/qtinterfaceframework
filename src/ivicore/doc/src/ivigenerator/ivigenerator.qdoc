\title Qt IVI Generator
\keyword QFace

Qt IVI provides a way for you to describe interfaces using its own Interface Definition Language
(IDL) and then generate Qt/QML API code based on this definition. This generator is based on the
QFace library, that provides a generic autogeneration framework.

\section1 Known Limitations

Currently, Qt IVI generator has the following limitations:

\list
    \li There's no support for external C++ types, outside of the IDL, such as reusing a
        QGeoCoordinate inside a QFace IDL.
    \li Defined Interfaces can't be used as types in properties or function arguments.
    \li The \c map<> type is not supported.
    \li Any default values provided directly in the QFace file are currently ignored.
\endlist
