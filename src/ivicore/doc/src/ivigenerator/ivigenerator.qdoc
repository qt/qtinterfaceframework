\title Qt Interface Framework Generator
\keyword QFace

Qt Interface Framework provides a way for you to describe interfaces using its own Interface Definition Language
(IDL) and then generate Qt/QML API code based on this definition. This generator is based on the
QFace library, that provides a generic autogeneration framework.

    \li \l {QFace IDL Syntax}
    \li \l {Jinja Template Syntax}
    \li \l {Use the Generator}
    \li \l {Filter Reference}

    \li \l {Qt Interface Framework Inter-Process Communication Integration}{IPC Integration}

\section1 Known Limitations

Currently, Qt Interface Framework generator has the following limitations:

\list
    \li There's no support for external C++ types, outside of the IDL, such as reusing a
        QGeoCoordinate inside a QFace IDL.
    \li Defined Interfaces can't be used as types in properties or function arguments.
    \li The \c map<> type is not supported.
    \li Any default values provided directly in the QFace file are currently ignored.
\endlist
